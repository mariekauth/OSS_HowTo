# Open Source Software - How To

##Introduction
Welcome to the Open Source Software Network.

For over 15 years I have been developing websites. 
I have used mainly commercial "Closed Source Software" on Windows to accomplish this.
However, the time has come that I must expand my horizons and branch out into the 
world of Open Source Software and joining the developer communities.

Moving from Windows to Linux, and from Closed Source Software to Open Source Software 
is a huge leap and there is a lot that comes with these changes.

All of the development tools I am using will be changing to something a lot less
familiar. The tools I am accustom to using come with a GUI (Graphic User Interface), the
biggest change is that most of the tools I will now be using will be used from the
command line.

More than just a beginners guide, this project is being used by me to learn to work 
with GIT and the new tools. Additionally, it will be more of a record of my journey 
as I transition from Windows to Linux.
